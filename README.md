---

## Installation

You can install `dfc` from Homebrew:

```sh
brew install chainguard-dev/tap/dfc
```

You can also install `dfc` from source:

```sh
go install github.com/chainguard-dev/dfc@latest
```

You can also use the `dfc` container image (from Docker Hub or `cgr.dev`):

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work chainguard/dfc
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work cgr.dev/chainguard/dfc
```

## Usage

Convert Dockerfile and print converted contents to terminal:

```sh
dfc ./Dockerfile
```

Save the output to new Dockerfile called `Dockerfile.chainguard`:

```sh
dfc ./Dockerfile > ./Dockerfile.chainguard
```

You can also pipe from stdin:

```sh
cat ./Dockerfile | dfc -
```

Convert the file in-place using `--in-place` / `-i` (saves backup in `.bak` file):

```sh
dfc --in-place ./Dockerfile
mv ./Dockerfile.bak ./Dockerfile # revert
```

Note: the `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.chainguard` in the root of this repo are not actually for building `dfc`, they
are symlinks to files in the [`testdata/`](./testdata/) folder so users can run the commands in this README.

## Configuration

### Chainguard org (cgr.dev namespace)

By default, FROM lines that have been mapped to Chainguard images will use "ORG" as a placeholder under `cgr.dev`:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/ORG/<image>
```

To configure your `cgr.dev` namespace use the `--org` flag:

```
dfc --org="example.com" ./Dockerfile
```

Resulting in:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/example.com/<image>
```

If mistakenly ran `dfc` with no configuration options and just want to replace the ORG
in the converted file, you can run something like this:

```sh
sed "s|/ORG/|/example.com/|" ./Dockerfile > dfc.tmp && mv dfc.tmp ./Dockerfile
```

### Alternate registry

To use an alternative registry domain and root namespace, use the `--registry` flag:

```
dfc --registry="r.example.com/cgr-mirror" ./Dockerfile
```

Resulting in:

```Dockerfile
FROM r.example.com/cgr-mirror/<image>
```

Note: the `--registry` flag takes precedence over the `--org` flag.

### Custom mappings file

If you need to use a modified version of the default, embedded mappings
file [`mappings.yaml`](./mappings.yaml), use the `--mappings` flag:

```sh
dfc --mappings="./custom-mappings.yaml" ./Dockerfile
```

Want to submit an update to the default [`mappings.yaml`](./mappings.yaml)?
Please [open a GitHub pull request](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/dfc/compare).

## Examples

For complete before and after examples, see the [`testdata/`](./testdata/) folder.

### Convert a single `FROM` line

```sh
echo "FROM node" | dfc -
```

Result:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/ORG/node:latest-dev
```

### Convert a single `RUN` line

```sh
echo "RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nano" | dfc -
```

Result:

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache nano
```

### Convert a whole Dockerfile

```sh
cat <<DOCKERFILE | dfc -
FROM node
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nano
DOCKERFILE
```

Result:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/ORG/node:latest-dev
USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache nano
```

## Supported platforms

`dfc` detects the package manager being used and maps this to
a supported distro in order to properly convert RUN lines.
The following platforms are recognized:

| OS                           | Package manager            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Alpine ("alpine")            | `apk`                      |
| Debian/Ubuntu ("debian")     | `apt-get` / `apt`          |
| Fedora/RedHat/UBI ("fedora") | `yum` / `dnf` / `microdnf` |


## How it works

### `FROM` line modifications

For each `FROM` line in the Dockerfile, `dfc` attempts to replace the base image with an equivalent Chainguard Image.

### `RUN` line modifications

For each `RUN` line in the Dockerfile, `dfc` attempts to detect the use of a known package manager (e.g. `apt-get` / `yum` / `apk`), extract the names of any packages being installed, try to map them via the package mappings in [`mappings.yaml`](./mappings.yaml), and replacing the old install with  `apk add --no-cache <packages>`.

### `USER` line modifications

If `dfc` has detected the use of a package manager and ended up converting a RUN line,
then `USER root` will be appended under the last `FROM` line.

In the future we plan to handle this more elegantly, but this is the current state.

### `ARG` line modifications

For each `ARG` line in the Dockerfile, `dfc` checks if the ARG is used as a base image in a subsequent `FROM` line. If it is, and the ARG has a default value that appears to be a base image, then `dfc` will modify the default value to use a Chainguard Image instead.

## Special considerations

### Busybox command syntax

#### useradd/groupadd vs. adduser/addgroup

Since adding users and groups in Chainguard Images in Dockerfiles requires
`adduser` / `addgroup` (via busybox), when we detect the use of
`useradd` or `groupadd` commands in `RUN` lines, we will automatically try to
convert them to the equivalent `adduser` / `addgroup` commands.

If we see that you have installed the `shadow` package
(which actually provides `useradd` and `groupadd`), then we do not modify
these commands and leave them as is.

#### tar command

The syntax for the `tar` command is slightly different in busybox than it is
in the GNU version which is present by default on various distros.

For that reason, we will attempt to convert `tar` commands in `RUN` lines
using the GNU syntax to use the busybox syntax instead.

## Base image and tag mapping

When converting Dockerfiles, `dfc` applies the following logic to determine which Chainguard Image and tag to use:

### Base Image Mapping
- Image mappings are defined in the `mappings.yaml` file under the `images` section
- Each mapping defines a source image name (e.g., `ubuntu`, `nodejs`) and its Chainguard equivalent
- Glob matching is supported using the asterisk (*) wildcard (e.g., `nodejs*` matches both `nodejs` and `nodejs20-debian12`)
- If a mapping includes a tag (e.g., `chainguard-base:latest`), that tag is always used
- If no tag is specified in the mapping (e.g., `node`), tag selection follows the standard tag mapping rules
- If no mapping is found for a base image, the original name is preserved and tag mapping rules apply

### Tag Mapping
The tag conversion follows these rules:

1. **For chainguard-base**:
   - Always uses `latest` tag, regardless of the original tag or presence of RUN commands

2. **For tags containing ARG variables** (like `${NODE_VERSION}`):
   - Preserves the original variable reference
   - Adds `-dev` suffix only if the stage contains RUN commands
   - Example: `FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}` → `FROM cgr.dev/ORG/node:${NODE_VERSION}-dev` (if stage has RUN commands)

3. **For other images**:
   - If no tag is specified in the original Dockerfile:
     - Uses `latest-dev` if the stage contains RUN commands
     - Uses `latest` if the stage has no RUN commands
   - If a tag is specified:
     - If it's a semantic version (e.g., `1.2.3` or `v1.2.3`):
       - Truncates to major.minor only (e.g., `1.2`)
       - Adds `-dev` suffix only if the stage contains RUN commands
     - If the tag starts with `v` followed by numbers, the `v` is removed
     - For non-semver tags (e.g., `alpine`, `slim`):
       - Uses `latest-dev` if the stage has RUN commands
       - Uses `latest` if the stage has no RUN commands

This approach ensures that:
- Development variants (`-dev`) with shell access are only used when needed
- Semantic version tags are simplified to major.minor for better compatibility
- The final stage in multi-stage builds uses minimal images without dev tools when possible
- Build arg variables in tags are preserved with proper `-dev` suffix handling

### Examples
- `FROM node:14` → `FROM cgr.dev/ORG/node:14-dev` (if stage has RUN commands)
- `FROM node:14.17.3` → `FROM cgr.dev/ORG/node:14.17-dev` (if stage has RUN commands)
- `FROM debian:bullseye` → `FROM cgr.dev/ORG/chainguard-base:latest` (always)
- `FROM golang:1.19-alpine` → `FROM cgr.dev/ORG/go:1.19` (if stage has RUN commands)
- `FROM node:${VERSION}` → `FROM cgr.dev/ORG/node:${VERSION}-dev` (if stage has RUN commands)

## JSON mode

Get converted Dockerfile as JSON using `--json` / `-j`:

```sh
dfc --json ./Dockerfile
```

Pipe it to `jq`:

```sh
dfc -j ./Dockerfile | jq
```

### Useful jq formulas

Reconstruct the Dockerfile pre-conversion:

```sh
dfc -j ./Dockerfile | jq -r '.lines[]|(.extra + .raw)'
```

Reconstruct the Dockerfile post-conversion:

```sh
dfc -j ./Dockerfile | jq -r '.lines[]|(.extra + (if .converted then .converted else .raw end))'
```

Convert and strip comments:

```sh
dfc -j ./Dockerfile | jq -r '.lines[]|(if .converted then .converted else .raw end)'
```

Get list of all distros detected from RUN lines:

```sh
dfc -j ./Dockerfile | jq -r '.lines[].run.distro' | grep -v null | sort -u
```

Get list of package managers detected from RUN lines:

```sh
dfc -j ./Dockerfile | jq -r '.lines[].run.manager' | grep -v null | sort -u
```

Get all the packages initially detected during parsing:

```sh
dfc -j ./Dockerfile | jq -r '.lines[].run.packages' | grep '"' | cut -d'"' -f 2 | sort -u | xargs
```

## Using from Go

The package `github.com/chainguard-dev/dfc/pkg/dfc` can be imported in Go and you can
parse and convert Dockerfiles on your own without the `dfc` CLI:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"strings"

	"github.com/chainguard-dev/dfc/pkg/dfc"
)

var (
	raw = []byte(strings.TrimSpace(`
		FROM node
		RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nano
	`))

	org = "example.com"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Parse the Dockefile bytes
	dockerfile, err := dfc.ParseDockerfile(ctx, raw)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("ParseDockerfile(): %v", err)
	}

	// Convert
	converted, err := dockerfile.Convert(ctx, dfc.Options{
		Organization: org,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("dockerfile.Convert(): %v", err)
	}

	// Print converted Dockerfile content
	fmt.Println(converted)
}
```

## Limitations

- **Incomplete Conversion**: The tool makes a best effort to convert Dockerfiles but does not guarantee that the converted Dockerfiles will be buildable by Docker.
- **Comment and Spacing Preservation**: While the tool attempts to preserve comments and spacing, there may be cases where formatting is altered during conversion.
- **Dynamic Variables**: The tool may not handle dynamic variables in Dockerfiles correctly, especially if they are used in complex expressions.
- **Unsupported Directives**: Some Dockerfile directives may not be fully supported or converted, leading to potential build issues.
- **Package Manager Commands**: The tool focuses on converting package manager commands but may not cover all possible variations or custom commands.
- **Multi-stage Builds**: While the tool supports multi-stage builds, it may not handle all edge cases, particularly with complex stage dependencies.
- **Platform-Specific Features**: The tool may not account for platform-specific features or optimizations in Dockerfiles.
- **Security Considerations**: The tool does not perform security checks on the converted Dockerfiles, and users should review the output for potential vulnerabilities.
